##  Description

This repository showcases a collection of solutions built using LangChain and related tools, covering both text and image domains. The project includes:

Image Similarity Search:
Build an image retrieval system using OpenCLIP embeddings and FAISS. The solution encodes images (e.g., cats and dogs) into vector representations and demonstrates how to query similar images using both text descriptions and image inputs.
Text Chunking and Vector Storage:
Implement a text processing pipeline that reads documents, splits them into manageable chunks, and stores the chunks in a FAISS vector store. This solution highlights how to use LangChain's text splitters, document wrappers, and vector search capabilities for efficient retrieval.
Additional LangChain Solutions:
Explore other advanced LangChain functionalities such as metadata extraction, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and citation handling through dedicated notebooks.
